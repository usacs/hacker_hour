Web is full of request/response
    - Google.com is the same. 
    - Parts of an HTTP Request
        * GET/POST
        * Perhaps PUT/DELETE
    - HTTP IS STATELESS.
        * you go on sniper - it returns a response
        * You submit a snipe - it returns a diff response.
When you create an HTML file. Regardless of what request to send to that URL, it returns the same response.

Flask is going to allow us to customize our response based on the request that we send.
